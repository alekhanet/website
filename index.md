## Alekha.Net - mobile-first, knowledge base on top of plain text Markdown and remote sync 

Alekha is a movement for cognitive introspection - Think Del.icio.us meets note taking. 

**This is the future of note taking. Alekha is unwritten. It is bookmarked and downloaded.**

It's a mobile-first, knowledge base on top of plain text Markdown and remote sync.

### Autogenerate your notes...dont author them

Most knowledge is not authored. It is browsed, saved, discussed, debated. That is why Alekha is envisioned as a tool that downloads and automatically annotates content. And most importantly creates **"blocks"** (that you can link/share/backlink).

Our parsers are continually enriched with context - on what it means to be a block and where should it exist in your semantic graph. Most notes are copy pasted anyway - so we are taking away the need to author most notes and automatically generate them.

And with OpenAI GPT-3 integration (coming soon), you will be able to compose without writing.

Use the app to save tweets, threads, links...literally anything. You will magically see the full content saved to your inbox as annotated markdown with automatic blocks. Which you can now slice and dice and share.

### OpenAI Codex is not a tool. Its a new content format
For the first time ever, code will be represented as a recipe. A recipe that can be shared, annotated, referred to. By the power of block-level backlinking, imagine your Codex recipes being pulled into other recipes. This is not code... its content.


### Alekha - unwritten knowledge.

Alekha comes from the Sanskrit root lekh or likh, which means “to write”. Alekh means that which is “unwritten”, an implicit challenge to the educated authorities and the colonial institutionalisation of their written texts
